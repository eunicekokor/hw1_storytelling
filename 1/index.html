    <h3> About </h3>
    <p style="display:none;" id="information">
      The stream I created is based upon the Markit On Demand Stock Quote API. For more information on the API itself, see below.</p>
    <p>
      **API Used:** <a href="http://dev.markitondemand.com/MODApis/">Markit On Demand's Stock Quote API</a>, which is an API that allows anyone to see the current value of a company's stock for companies traded on the BATS Exchange, also known as "Better Alternative Trading System". When querying for a company's current stock, it returns a lot of additional information, including the volume of the stock, the change (both by % and number) since the previous day's close and more information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every five seconds, I query this API for the current stock price of Facebook, Inc. which is an online social networking platform and service that has been operating since 2004. Because this API returns information at the current time, I wanted the stream the following:
      <p> 1. The initial price at the time the stream is opened - Basically, if we want to see how the Facebook stock price is changing throughout the day (or whatever length of time we want to analyze) a starting point is important.</p>
      <p>2. The exact time that that price was fetched. - If someone analyzing my stream needed to fact check or saw a one second discrepency, it would be important to document the time in which my stream parsed this assumed live data.</p>
      <p>3. An output reflecting changed prices. - This is important for the following reasons: a. The stock market opens and closes at approximately 9:30am and 4:00pm respectively, so my stream won't output more than one result (supposedly if there are no fluctuations before or after those times) before 9:30am or after 4:00pm. b. I only wanted to reflect the changing nature of the stock market, so my stream is an accurate representation of what is happening in real life with the stocks within 5 seconds.</p>
